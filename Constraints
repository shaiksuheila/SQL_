>>SQL constraints are used to specify rules for data in a table.
>>Constraints can be specified when the table is created with the CREATE TABLE statement, or after the table is created with the ALTER TABLE statement.

SYNTAX:

CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype constraint,
    column2 datatype constraint,
    column3 datatype constraint,
    ....
);
---------------------------------------------
1.NOT NULL:
By default, a column can hold NULL values.
The NOT NULL constraint enforces a column to NOT accept NULL values.
This enforces a field to always contain a value, which means that you cannot insert a new record, or update a record without adding a value to this field.

example:
Create table school(
  name varchar(255)not null,
  rollno int not null
  );
ALTER TABLE Persons
ALTER COLUMN Age int NOT NULL;

2.UNIQUE CONSTRAINT:
The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different.
Both the UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints provide a guarantee for uniqueness for a column or set of columns.
A PRIMARY KEY constraint automatically has a UNIQUE constraint.

3.PRIMARY KEY:
The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table.
Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values.

4.FOREIGN KEY:
A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table. 
FOREIGN KEY ACTS AS CHILD KEY

5.CHECK:
The CHECK constraint is used to limit the value range that can be placed in a column.
If you define a CHECK constraint on a column it will allow only certain values for this column.
If you define a CHECK constraint on a table it can limit the values in certain columns based on values in other columns in the row.

6.DEFAULT :
The DEFAULT constraint is used to set a default value for a column.
The default value will be added to all new records, if no other value is specified.

7.INDEX:
The CREATE INDEX statement is used to create indexes in tables.
Indexes are used to retrieve data from the database more quickly than otherwise. The users cannot see the indexes, they are just used to speed up searches/queries
